\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
Long-range angular correlations for pairs of charged particles are studied in pp collisions at ${\sqrt{{\textit s}}}=13$~TeV and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV. Flow coefficients are extracted from long-range correlations ($1.6 <|\Delta\eta| < 1.8$) for a broad range of charge-particle-multiplicity event classes using the template method, which allows one to subtract the enhanced away-side jet fragmentation yields in high-multiplicity events with respect to low-multiplicity events. The method that was used to measure the flow coefficients within the considered kinematic ranges has been verified to be stable.

to be stable. The systematic uncertainties on v2 and v3 measurements which reflect the possible differences in the away-side jet peak shapes in high- and low-multiplicity events were found to be 1\% and 3â€“8\%, respectively.
However, it is important that these systematic uncertainties are reevaluated, when analyzing different kinematic ranges, as the effect may not always be negligible.
The measured $p_\mathrm{T}$ dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ is consistent with the measurements by ATLAS, and shows that both $v_2$ and $v_3$ increase with pT and reach their maximum at $2.5<p_\mathrm{T}<3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$.
The measurement of $v_2$ as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in $|\eta|<0.5$ shows a weak multiplicity dependence both for pp and p--Pb collisions and tends to decrease toward lower multiplicities.
%In pp collisions the results reveal a hint of a disappearing $v_2$ signal below $N_{\mathrm{ch}} = 10$. 
The pp data suggests that the $v_2$ signal may disappear when the measurement is pursued further below $N_{\mathrm{ch}} = 10$. 
%However, it cannot be definitively excluded whether there is a complete disappearance of the $v_2$ signal below this threshold due to the limited statistical precision of the data.

The comparisons to viscous hydrodynamic models show that the magnitudes of $v_2$ and their multiplicity dependence are not described by state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations, which simulated initial conditions with two initial state models, especially for low-multiplicity p--Pb and pp collisions. As initial state effects tend to be more important at low multiplicity~\cite{Greif:2017bnr,Moreland:2018gsh}, these results may help to constrain the modeling of the initial state.
Furthermore, the events including hard probes such as jets or high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ leading particles do not show any changes both in $v_2$ and $v_3$ within the uncertainties, which implies that the long-range correlation of soft particles is not significantly modified by the presence of the hard-scattering process. Even though it would be interesting to compare these results to the EPOS LHC~\cite{Pierog:2013ria} and PYTHIA8 String Shoving models~\cite{Bierlich:2017vhg,Bierlich:2019ixq} as done in Ref.~\cite{ALICE:2012eyl} for the ridge yields, it is not possible to reliably extract the flow coefficients because these models exhibit a near-side ridge structure in low-multiplicity events, thus making the use of the low-multiplicity template ill defined~\cite{Ji:2023eqn}.
