\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
Long-range angular correlations for pairs of charged particles are studied in pp at ${\sqrt{{\textit s}}}=13$~TeV and in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV. Flow coefficients are extracted from long-range correlations ($\Delta\eta > 1.6$) for a broad range of multiplicity event classes using the template  method, which allows one to subtract the enhanced away-side jet fragmentation yields in high-multiplicity events with respect to low-multiplicity events.

These $p_\mathrm{T}$ dependent results are consistent with ATLAS, and $v_n$ becomes larger for higher $p_\mathrm{T}$, and maximum of $v_n$ is reached at $2.5<p_\mathrm{T}<3.0$ GeV/$c$. 
The measurement of $v_2$ as a function of charged particle multiplicity $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ in $|\eta|<0.5$ shows a weak multiplicity dependence on $v_2$ both for pp and p--Pb collisions and tends to decrease toward the lower multiplicities. The results in pp collisions reveal a hint of a disappearing $v_2$ signal below $N_{\mathrm{ch}} = 10$. However, the statistical precision of the data is limited, so we cannot definitively exclude the possibility of a complete disappearance of the $v_2$ signal below this threshold. 
The comparisons to viscous hydrodynamic models show that the magnitudes of $v_2$ and their multiplicity dependence are not described by state-of-art hydrodynamic calculations with two initial state models, especially for low multiplicity p--Pb and pp collisions. As initial state effects tend to be more important at low multiplicity 
~\cite{Greif:2017bnr,Moreland:2018gsh}, these results may help to constrain the modelling of the initial
State.

Furthermore, the events with hard probes such as jets or leading particles do not show any changes both in $v_2$ and $v_3$ within the uncertainties which implies that the long-range correlation involving soft particles is not significantly changed by the presence of a hard-scattering process. 
Even though it would be interesting to compare these results to EPOS LHC~\cite{Pierog:2013ria} and PYTHIA8 String Shoving models~\cite{Bierlich:2017vhg,Bierlich:2019ixq} as done in \cite{ALICE:2012eyl} for the ridge yields, it is not possible to reliably extract flow coefficients because these models exhibit flow or ridge signals in low-multiplicity events, thus making the use of a low-multiplicity template unfeasible~\cite{Ji:2023eqn}.
